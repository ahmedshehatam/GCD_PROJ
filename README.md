==================================================================
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
==================================================================
Cleaned by Ahmed Shehata
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 


For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 79-feature vector with average time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'CodeBook.md': explain the different variables of the data set

- 'tidy_data.txt': List of all average of mean and std observations grouped by each activity for each subject 

- 'run_analysis.R': the R script used to generate the previous clean data file.
